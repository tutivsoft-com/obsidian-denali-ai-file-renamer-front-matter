# üìÇ Denali AI File Renamer: Your Files, Evolved

Denali AI is a groundbreaking plugin that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to bring intelligent automation to your file management workflow. In today's digital world, our notes and documents are the bedrock of our knowledge, but they often become a tangled mess of generic or confusing names like "Untitled 2.md" or "My_Project_Final_v3.docx". This is where Denali AI steps in. It goes beyond simple automation by analyzing the actual content of your files to suggest not just a descriptive name, but also rich, meaningful metadata, creating a truly smart and self-organizing knowledge base. Without AI, this level of contextual understanding is simply not possible; you'd be stuck with rigid, rule-based systems that can't comprehend nuance. Denali AI transforms your digital chaos into a structured, searchable, and elegant system, freeing you to focus on creating, not organizing.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Denali AI is designed for simplicity. Once installed and configured, you have two primary ways to use it.

1.  **For a Single File**:
    * Right-click on any `.md` file in the file explorer.
    * Select `Rename File with Denali AI`.
    * Depending on your settings, a modal will appear with a suggested new name, or the file will be renamed automatically.

2.  **For an Entire Folder**:
    * Right-click on any folder in the file explorer.
    * Select `Batch Rename Folder with Denali AI`.
    * The plugin will automatically go through all markdown files in the folder (and its subfolders) and apply the renaming process. You can optionally configure it to only target "untitled" files.

**Pro-Tip**: You can also use the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for `Denali AI` to access the main commands.
